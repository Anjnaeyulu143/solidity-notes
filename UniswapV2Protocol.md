UniswapV2 Protocol
---------------------

Uniswap is a decentralised exchange protocol. This protocol is a suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker.

The Uniswap ecosystem consists of liquidity providers who contribute to liquidity, traders who swap the tokens and developers who interact with smart contracts to develop new interactions for the tokens.
